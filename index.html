            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small ">The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc.[2][3] The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced
                to various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits.[1] The board has 14 digital I/O pins (six capable of PWM output), 6 analog I/O pins, and is programmable with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), via a type B
                USB cable.[4] It can be powered by the USB cable or by an external 9-volt battery, though it accepts voltages between 7 and 20 volts. It is similar to the Arduino Nano and Leonardo.[5][6] The hardware reference design is distributed under
                a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 2.5 license and is available on the Arduino website. Layout and production files for some versions of the hardware are also available. The word "uno" means "one" in Italian and was chosen to mark
                the initial release of Arduino Software.[1] The Uno board is the first in a series of USB-based Arduino boards;[3] it and version 1.0 of the Arduino IDE were the reference versions of Arduino, which have now evolved to newer releases.[4]
                The ATmega328 on the board comes preprogrammed with a bootloader that allows uploading new code to it without the use of an external hardware programmer. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small ">Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling
                algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible
                to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex
                as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal
                logic. Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. These might
                be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering combines
                engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse engineering is a related process used by designers, analysts and programmers to understand and re-create/re-implement.[3]:3 </p>

                graphics drawing and database access. A summary of some key core Android libraries available to the Android developer is as follows − android.app − Provides access to the application model and is the cornerstone of all Android applications.
                android.content − Facilitates content access, publishing and messaging between applications and application components. android.database − Used to access data published by content providers and includes SQLite database management classes.
                android.opengl − A Java interface to the OpenGL ES 3D graphics rendering API. android.os − Provides applications with access to standard operating system services including messages, system services and inter-process communication. android.text
                − Used to render and manipulate text on a device display. android.view − The fundamental building blocks of application user interfaces. android.widget − A rich collection of pre-built user interface components such as buttons, labels,
                list views, layout managers, radio buttons etc. android.webkit − A set of classes intended to allow web-browsing capabilities to be built into applications </p>
